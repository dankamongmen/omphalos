=======================================
Networking
=======================================

We cannot assume that we will see all traffic, due to drops, switched
networks, wireless topography, and physical/network-layer encryption.

We cannot transmit with another station's hardware address; this will not
be generally allowed in a switched network.

We cannot assume that we have an IP address on a local network; this
requires configuration, and will never be the case for eg a bridge.

We cannot assume other hosts are not misconfigured, broken, or adversarial.

=======================================
UIs/clients
=======================================

Callback functions might be called by any number of different threads,
possibly concurrently. No relationship can be assumed between threads and
callbacks.

Callbacks are like interrupt handlers. There is a finite ringbuffer for
incoming packets. Packet handling must proceed at wire rate, or else the
ringbuffer will eventually be filled up. GUI events cannot generally
proceed at wire rate, so packet handlers must generally aggregate events
and dispatch work.

=======================================
Porting
=======================================

Omphalos uses several advanced features of the Linux kernel directly, and
many use cases require other functionality. Porting will involve, at
minimum:

 - a means of reading packets from the wire (traditional packet(7) sockets,
    libpcap, etc)
 - a means of transmitting packets on the wire (traditional packet(7)
    sockets)
 - a means of acquiring link, address, route and neighbor information from
    the kernel (we use rtnetlink). this has traditionally been a messy set
    of ioctl()s on linux, which would have to be poll()ed.
 - a means of acquiring physical information from the kernel, especially
    for wireless devices (we use nl80211).
 - a means of dropping general privileges, but retaining those capabilities
    necessary for network activity (perhaps a client/server process pair'
    communicating over PF_UNIX sockets).
