The UI is modeled on a rotating reel with interfaces printed on the outside
(think of a slot machine). This way, continuous rotation is possible without
wraparound at some arbitrary point. This seems much more intuitive on touch
screens, an eventual environment of omphalos.

Interfaces grow and shrink. It is not useful for an interface to grow larger
than the screen itself, yet their logical size does arbitrarily grow. We thus
arbitrarily cap size at the screensize; it is thus required that we can scroll
through more interface details than can be displayed in the interface.

If any interfaces are displayed, one is the "current interface", the default
target of UI actions. This interface ought always be onscreen. Since it can
grow arbitrarily, starting from some size at some row, we must support pushing
interfaces both up and down, and possibly offscreen. Pushing on an interface
means that interface pushes in the same direction; growing an interface can
thus result in numerous interfaces being pushed. Interfaces other than the
current interface can also grow, though they must not push the current
interface offscreen. While the current interface can grow in either direction,
other interfaces will:

 - grow in the direction opposite the current, unless this would push them
    partially offscreen (it's best if the current interface not move at all).
 - otherwise, push in the direction of the current interface, unless this would
    push the current interface partially offscreen (better to move the current
    interface than to possibly hide the new data).
 - otherwise, partially push themselves offscreen.
