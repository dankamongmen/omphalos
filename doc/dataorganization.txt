Data Organization and Entry Points
==================================

Our input sources include packet sockets, the operating system's netlink
infrastructure, filesystem events, and UI events.

Actions invoked by the UI and service interrogations performed automatically by
omphalos will most often operate naturally at layer 3 or above: a port scan
cannot be run against a MAC, nor can a DNS request be issued to one. Inputs
from the packet socket, however, are most naturally keyed off of layer 2
(especially since a given layer 3 address can show up on multiple layer 2
networks, which MAC addresses' global uniqueness property makes less common).
The netlink layer, meanwhile, refers almost exclusively to logical interfaces,
and various device properties are associated with physical interfaces.

It must be remembered that misconfigured and adversarial peers can violate the
expected properties at any layer save the physical. Other cases to consider,
with definite effects on network modeling, include:

 - multipath routing
 - line bonding
 - proxy ARP
 - disconnected IP networks (local overload of global IP space)
 - multiple cards on the same medium
 - multihoming
 - fail-over/load-balancing
 - unconfigured local networking
 - movement among physical networks without local networking changes
 - same mac address on different networks
 - etc. ...

It would be useful if logical interfaces could determine that they share a
medium, but this seems impossible in the general case. Seeing the same hardware
address on multiple interfaces could be the result of generated addresses,
misconfigurations, adversaries, or use of well-known addresses (primarily
multicast and broadcast). Seeing the other card's generated packets could be
the result of misconfiguration, adversarial routing/bridging, adversarial
packet generation (a node with connections to both distinct media could
replicate packets from one to another), etc.
