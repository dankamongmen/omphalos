track selection and selectionline. selectionline is relative to iface window,
 not screen. when drawing, draw from the selection out in each direction.
 growing can change selectionline (grow up with insert before selection) while
 retaining the same position on-screen.

we want a double list, but the traversal order is not a simple inversion. we
walk forward via the hierarchy semantic, and backwards via the display
semantic:

NULL
  ^--node ---------------> node -> NULL
      | ^--.                 |
      -> host -> NULL        |
          | ^--.             |
          -> service -> NULL |
                 ^----<------/

we could get rid of all these NULLs if we encoded the hierarchy level
directly into the various nodes...which we have to do to use the display
semantic backwards...this means we'd have to walk sublevels, though, to
traverse upper levels.

maybe we only want a backlink between nodes?

if iface_lines_unbounded() > available lines, some are hidden.
as new ones are added / removed, we want to keep the selected interface
 in the same position, relative to the interface boundaries.
moving up and down can change the position relative to interface boundaries.

if the iface occupies the entire screen, no addition or removal should displace
 the current selection.

---------------------
-browsing selections-
---------------------
move to previous or next. --selection or ++selection.
likewise, selline -= (line of prev) or += (lines of cur)
 if selline < 1, selline = 1.
 if selline + (lines of new cur) >= maxy


     ----------------------------
     -handling interface changes-
     ----------------------------
(when that interface has a selection.)

if the iface has room to grow in either direction, grow so that the selection
 is not displaced (we currently prefer, arbitrarily, to grow down). this might
 not be possible in the case where the selection is the first or last in the
 interface.

if the iface has room to grow in only one direction, grow in that direction,
 retaining the current (possibly displaced) selection.
